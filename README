It's heavily recommended to first make all the labs of course 01!

Added Jasmine tests that you can run using 'node runner' in the respective course directories

How-to run the Jasmine tests:
# Download NodeJS
# Download NPM (Node Package Manager)
# "npm install jasmine"
# navigate to any of the course directories (e.g. jasmine/calculate)
# "node runner" will run the specs
